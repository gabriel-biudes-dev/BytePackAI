# BytePackAI
BytePackAI is a machine learning tool that classifies executable files as packed or not packed using byte histograms. It leverages a Random Forest Classifier to detect packing, an obfuscation technique used in malware. With a simple CLI, users can train the model or classify files, helping automate malware analysis.
